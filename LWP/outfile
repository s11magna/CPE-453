Test Results:
   These are the results of trying your liblwp.so
against several programs with different characteristics 
described by the filename.  The output of your program
is compared to a reference output using diff(1).  If they
differ, the test case is a failure.

=================================================
TEST 26: Does tid2thread return the right thread?

This is the similar numbersmain program distributed with the
assignment, but with a scheduler that returns a random thread.
(seeded, so reproducible).  After 50 iterations, the last thread runs
through the list of all threads and sees if tid2thread is returning
the right context.

calls tid2thread() a bunch.
